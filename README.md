# sumMatrix
This is a parallel programming project.
The master node generates a large scale matrix (e.g., 10,000 * 10,000 of random integer numbers), divides the matrix into several parts and distributes these parts to different nodes. Each node receives the data and computes the sum simultaneously and returns the result to the master node.
