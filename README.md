# sumMatrix
This is a course project.
It generates a large scale matrix (10,000 * 10,000 of integer numbers) and divides the matrix into several parts, 
then it distributes these parts to different nodes. Each node does the sum calculation and returns the result to 
the master node. MPI libraries is used.
